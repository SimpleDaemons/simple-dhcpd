# Advanced Configurations

This directory contains advanced configuration examples for complex networking scenarios requiring sophisticated DHCP setups.

## Files

### multi-vlan.yaml
Complex multi-VLAN setup with advanced features:
- **5 VLANs**: Management, Production, Development, Guest, IoT
- **Static Reservations**: Critical infrastructure devices
- **IP Exclusions**: Reserved ranges for static devices
- **Advanced Security**: MAC filtering, rate limiting, DHCP snooping
- **Comprehensive Logging**: File rotation, syslog integration

**Use case**: Enterprise networks, data centers, complex office environments

### load-balanced.yaml
High-availability setup with multiple DHCP servers:
- **Load Balancing**: Multiple DHCP servers for redundancy
- **Failover Support**: Backup servers for critical services
- **High Capacity**: 10,000+ leases supported
- **Advanced Monitoring**: Comprehensive logging and rotation
- **Production Ready**: Enterprise-grade configuration

**Use case**: Large enterprises, mission-critical applications, high-availability environments

## Key Features

### Multi-VLAN Architecture
- **Segmentation**: Separate VLANs for different purposes
- **Security**: Isolated networks with controlled access
- **Scalability**: Support for hundreds of devices per VLAN
- **Management**: Centralized configuration with VLAN-specific settings

### High Availability
- **Redundancy**: Multiple DHCP servers prevent single points of failure
- **Load Distribution**: Traffic spread across multiple servers
- **Failover**: Automatic failover when primary servers fail
- **Monitoring**: Comprehensive logging for troubleshooting

### Advanced Security
- **DHCP Snooping**: Protection against rogue DHCP servers
- **MAC Filtering**: Whitelist/blacklist based on MAC addresses
- **Rate Limiting**: Protection against DHCP flooding attacks
- **Access Control**: Granular control over network access

### Enterprise Features
- **Static Reservations**: Guaranteed IP addresses for critical devices
- **IP Exclusions**: Reserved ranges for infrastructure
- **Advanced Options**: Custom DHCP options for specific needs
- **Comprehensive Logging**: Detailed logs for compliance and troubleshooting

## Configuration Guidelines

### VLAN Planning
1. **Management VLAN**: Infrastructure devices (switches, routers, servers)
2. **Production VLAN**: Business-critical applications and servers
3. **Development VLAN**: Development and testing environments
4. **Guest VLAN**: Public access with limited privileges
5. **IoT VLAN**: Internet of Things devices with restricted access

### IP Address Allocation
- **Static Reservations**: Use for critical infrastructure
- **DHCP Ranges**: Use for dynamic devices
- **Exclusions**: Reserve ranges for future static assignments
- **Documentation**: Keep detailed records of all assignments

### Security Considerations
- **Network Segmentation**: Isolate different types of traffic
- **Access Control**: Implement appropriate restrictions per VLAN
- **Monitoring**: Enable comprehensive logging and monitoring
- **Regular Audits**: Review and update security policies

## Deployment

### Prerequisites
- Network infrastructure supporting VLANs
- Switches with DHCP relay capability
- Monitoring and logging infrastructure
- Network security policies

### Installation
1. Choose the appropriate configuration
2. Customize IP ranges and VLANs for your environment
3. Configure network infrastructure (switches, routers)
4. Deploy DHCP servers with load balancing
5. Test failover and monitoring

### Monitoring
- Monitor DHCP server performance
- Track lease utilization
- Monitor security events
- Regular log analysis

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
- **VLAN Isolation**: Ensure proper switch configuration
- **DHCP Relay**: Verify relay agent configuration
- **Security Policies**: Check MAC filtering and access control
- **Performance**: Monitor server load and response times

### Debug Commands
```bash
# Check configuration
./simple-dhcpd -c config.yaml --validate

# Run with debug logging
./simple-dhcpd -c config.yaml --verbose --log-level DEBUG

# Monitor leases
tail -f /var/log/simple-dhcpd/simple-dhcpd.log | grep "lease"
```

## Next Steps

For even more advanced scenarios, consider:
- `../production/` - Enterprise-grade configurations
- `../security/` - Security-focused setups
- Custom configurations for specific requirements
