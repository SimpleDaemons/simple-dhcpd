### Debug Commands
```bash
# Validate configuration
./simple-dhcpd -c config.yaml --validate

# Run with debug logging
./simple-dhcpd -c config.yaml --verbose --log-level DEBUG

# Monitor leases
tail -f /var/log/simple-dhcpd/simple-dhcpd.log | grep "lease"

# Check security events
tail -f /var/log/simple-dhcpd/simple-dhcpd.log | grep "security"
```
