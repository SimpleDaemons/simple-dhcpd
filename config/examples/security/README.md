# Security-Focused Configuration Example

This configuration example demonstrates the comprehensive security features available in Simple DHCP Daemon, showcasing all Phase 3 advanced security capabilities.

## Security Features Demonstrated

### 1. DHCP Snooping
- **Enabled**: Validates DHCP messages against trusted bindings
- **Trusted Interfaces**: Only `eth0` is trusted for DHCP server communication
- **Logging**: All snooping events are logged for security analysis
- **Validation**: Strict validation of DHCP message sources

### 2. MAC Address Filtering
- **Mode**: Allow-list (only explicitly allowed MACs can get leases)
- **Wildcard Support**: Supports patterns like `00:11:22:33:44:*` for vendor filtering
- **Rule Management**: Individual rules can be enabled/disabled
- **Descriptions**: Each rule has a descriptive name for management

### 3. IP Address Filtering
- **Mode**: Allow-list (only explicitly allowed IPs can be assigned)
- **Exact Matching**: Supports specific IP address filtering
- **Rule Management**: Granular control over IP filtering rules

### 4. Rate Limiting
- **Multi-dimensional**: Separate limits for MAC addresses and IP addresses
- **Sliding Windows**: Uses time-based sliding windows for accurate rate limiting
- **Per-client Overrides**: Specific clients can have higher limits
- **Block Duration**: Configurable blocking period after limit exceeded

### 5. Option 82 (Relay Agent Information) Support
- **Validation**: Validates Option 82 data for circuit-id and remote-id
- **Interface-specific Rules**: Different requirements per interface
- **Trusted Relay Agents**: Pre-configured trusted relay agent combinations
- **Required vs Optional**: Some interfaces require Option 82, others don't

### 6. Client Authentication
- **HMAC-based**: Uses HMAC-SHA256 for client authentication
- **Credential Management**: Per-client password hashes and salts
- **Key Management**: Centralized authentication key configuration
- **Expiration Support**: Credentials can have expiration times

### 7. Security Event Logging
- **Comprehensive Logging**: All security events are logged
- **Alert Thresholds**: Configurable thresholds for security alerts
- **Retention**: 90-day log retention for compliance
- **JSON Format**: Structured logging for easy parsing

## Configuration Highlights

### MAC Filtering Rules
```json
"mac_filtering": {
  "enabled": true,
  "mode": "allow",
  "rules": [
    {
      "mac_address": "00:11:22:33:44:*",
      "allow": true,
      "description": "Corporate devices",
      "enabled": true
    }
  ]
}
```

### Rate Limiting Configuration
```json
"rate_limiting": {
  "enabled": true,
  "rules": [
    {
      "identifier": "*",
      "identifier_type": "mac",
      "max_requests": 50,
      "time_window": 60,
      "block_duration": 300,
      "enabled": true
    }
  ]
}
```

### Option 82 Validation
```json
"option_82": {
  "enabled": true,
  "validation": true,
  "rules": [
    {
      "interface": "eth1",
      "required": true,
      "enabled": true
    }
  ]
}
```

## Security Best Practices

1. **Enable DHCP Snooping**: Always enable on production networks
2. **Use MAC Filtering**: Implement allow-lists for known devices
3. **Configure Rate Limiting**: Prevent DHCP exhaustion attacks
4. **Validate Option 82**: Ensure relay agent information is valid
5. **Enable Authentication**: Use client authentication for sensitive networks
6. **Monitor Security Events**: Set up alerting for security violations
7. **Regular Log Review**: Review security logs for suspicious activity

## Use Cases

This configuration is ideal for:
- **Corporate Networks**: High-security environments with strict access control
- **Government Networks**: Compliance requirements and audit trails
- **Financial Institutions**: Multi-layered security approach
- **Healthcare Networks**: HIPAA compliance and device validation
- **Critical Infrastructure**: Industrial control systems and SCADA networks

## Monitoring and Alerting

The configuration includes comprehensive monitoring:
- **Security Event Thresholds**: Automatic alerting for suspicious activity
- **Rate Limit Monitoring**: Track and alert on rate limit violations
- **Authentication Failures**: Monitor failed authentication attempts
- **Filter Violations**: Track blocked MAC addresses and IP addresses

## Compliance Features

- **Audit Logging**: Complete audit trail of all DHCP operations
- **Data Retention**: 90-day log retention for compliance
- **Encrypted Storage**: Lease database encryption for sensitive data
- **Access Control**: Granular access control through filtering rules
