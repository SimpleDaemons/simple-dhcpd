# Security Configurations

This directory contains security-focused configuration examples designed for environments with high security requirements, compliance needs, and threat protection.

## Files

### high-security.yaml
Maximum security configuration with comprehensive protection:
- **4 VLANs**: Secure management, secure production, secure users, isolated guest
- **Enhanced Security**: MAC filtering, rate limiting, DHCP snooping, intrusion detection
- **Short Leases**: 15-30 minute lease times for maximum security
- **Strict Access Control**: Whitelist-only MAC addresses
- **Comprehensive Logging**: Detailed audit trails and security event logging
- **Authentication**: MAC-based authentication required

**Use case**: High-security environments, government networks, financial institutions

### zero-trust.yaml
Zero trust security configuration with maximum verification:
- **4 VLANs**: Zero trust management, production, users, guest
- **Zero Trust Principles**: Verify every request, block unknown devices
- **Certificate Authentication**: Certificate-based device authentication
- **Device Registration**: Require device registration before access
- **Ultra-Short Leases**: 10-15 minute lease times
- **Maximum Logging**: Log all activity for analysis

**Use case**: Zero trust networks, highly sensitive environments, compliance-critical systems

## Key Security Features

### Advanced Authentication
- **MAC-Based**: Device authentication based on MAC addresses
- **Certificate-Based**: Certificate validation for device authentication
- **Device Registration**: Require devices to be registered before access
- **Multi-Factor**: Multiple layers of authentication

### Intrusion Detection
- **Suspicious Activity**: Alert on unusual DHCP patterns
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevent DHCP flooding attacks
- **MAC Blocking**: Block suspicious or unknown MAC addresses
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Continuous security monitoring

### Access Control
- **Whitelist Only**: Only pre-approved devices allowed
- **MAC Filtering**: Granular control based on MAC addresses
- **Network Segmentation**: Isolated networks for different security levels
- **Dynamic Blocking**: Automatic blocking of suspicious devices

### Audit and Compliance
- **Comprehensive Logging**: Log all DHCP activity
- **Security Events**: Detailed security event logging
- **Audit Trails**: Complete audit trails for compliance
- **Real-time Alerts**: Immediate notification of security events

## Security Best Practices

### Network Segmentation
1. **Management Network**: Isolated infrastructure management
2. **Production Network**: Secure business-critical systems
3. **User Network**: Controlled user access
4. **Guest Network**: Isolated public access

### Access Control
- **Principle of Least Privilege**: Minimum necessary access
- **Regular Audits**: Regular review of access permissions
- **Device Management**: Strict device registration and management
- **Monitoring**: Continuous monitoring of network activity

### Threat Protection
- **DHCP Snooping**: Protection against rogue DHCP servers
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevention of flooding attacks
- **Intrusion Detection**: Real-time threat detection
- **Response Procedures**: Defined incident response procedures

### Compliance
- **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive logging for compliance
- **Data Retention**: Appropriate log retention policies
- **Regular Reviews**: Regular security policy reviews
- **Documentation**: Detailed security documentation

## Deployment

- **Intrusion Detection**: Investigate security alerts
- **Authentication**: Verify device authentication

### Debug Commands
```bash
# Validate security configuration
./simple-dhcpd -c config.yaml --validate --security-check

# Run with security debug logging
./simple-dhcpd -c config.yaml --verbose --log-level DEBUG --security-debug

# Monitor security events
tail -f /var/log/simple-dhcpd/simple-dhcpd.log | grep "security"

# Check authentication events
tail -f /var/log/simple-dhcpd/simple-dhcpd.log | grep "auth"
```
